This project is a dynamic one-page website built with React and Node.js, which allows for the display of a customizable banner on the main page. 
The banner's content and visibility can be controlled through an internal dashboard, and the banner settings are stored in a MySQL database.

## Features
Banner Display: A banner that can display a message, a clickable link, and a countdown timer.

Internal Dashboard: A control panel to update the banner's description, timer, link, and visibility.

Database Integration: All banner settings are stored in a MySQL database and can be dynamically updated.

## Project Structure
Backend (Node.js & Express): Provides RESTful APIs to interact with the MySQL database.

Frontend (React): Displays the banner and dashboard interface.

MySQL Database: Stores the banner details.

## Hosting
Frontend is hosted on Netlify, Backend on Render, which offers good logging, and a MySQL DB on CleverCloud

Will update the setup instructions soon, was in a hurry.
